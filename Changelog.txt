August 2018 (EnRogue) :
	- corrected weights (sources listed in yasim config)
	- corrected engine fuel consumption (https://en.valka.cz/topic/view/59420/Dobrynin-VD-7M-RD-7M2)
	- corrected fuel load, shifted tanks - positions are roughly correct, sizes are guesses (tank 0 which is normally deleted is 5000l)
	- corrected approach speed, near enough aoa, correct weight
	- correct cruise numbers (speed, weight, engine setting)
	- tweaked until numbers looked reasonable (I've lost count of the number of iterations I've done)
	- reduced particle effects (smoke, tyres) so they are more subtle
	- made contrail dependent on environment/contrail
	- added tags
	- added single preview/splashscreen
	- added basic autopilot
	- basic nasal fuel management, needs tweaking to manage CG
	- tweaked sounds, added jet blast
	- variable area nozzle controlled by property rule
	- added nasal parachute (modelled as single 104sqm, real is dual canopy 52sqm)

Sept 2018 (EnRogue) :
	- ALS afterburner
	- Old AB & exhaust effect only appear with fixed renderer & rembrandt
	- Updated glass & fuselage reflection effects
	- changed AP to act on control rather than trim

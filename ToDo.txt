As of August 2018 (EnRogue):
	- tags (done)
	- splash screens (done)
	- external sounds need jet blast roar (done)
	- check why interior engine sound can only be heard above a certain rpm (made some tweaks, a little better)
	- some instruments are not hooked up (alpha, compass, engine temp)
	- autopilot (done basic)
	- afterburner needs ALS effect (should be orange according to photos - done)
	- tailplane should be all moving (animation, 3d model needs changing)
	- afterburner petals need animation fixed (done via property rules)
	- gear compression looks too low, and rear gear compression animation is wrong (sinks into ground) - (redone, seems ok)
	- rear gear is supposed to rotate front wheels down when weight off
	- tanks in the right place based on sources below (done)
	- need brake parachute (double cross type, orange & white), can use nasal one (done)
	- outboard flap should be 20 deg, inboard 35 deg (done)
	- outboard flap becomes flaperon when gear up, aileron locked (due to aileron reversal at high speed - animation only?)
	- landing lights in wing roots
